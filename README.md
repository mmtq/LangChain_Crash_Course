# LangChain Crash Course üöÄ
Welcome to the LangChain Crash Course repository! This project is a hands-on guide to learning and practicing LangChain, a powerful framework for building applications powered by language models. In this course, I explored various LangChain concepts such as chat models, prompt templates, chains, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and agents, using the ChatGroq API.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository will help you understand and implement LangChain components effectively.

## üìö Topics Covered
### Chat Models:

- Using ChatGroq API for conversational AI.

- Integrating chat models into LangChain.

### Prompt Templates:

- Creating reusable and dynamic prompts.

- Customizing prompts for specific tasks.

### Chains:

- Building sequential workflows with LangChain.

- Combining multiple components (e.g., prompts, models, tools) into a single chain.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

- Implementing RAG for context-aware question answering.

- Using Chroma DB for vector storage and retrieval.

### Agents:

- Creating autonomous agents that can perform tasks.

- Integrating tools and memory into agents.
